					<span class="text-4xl font-bold">The History.</span> If you use digital music equipment, odds
					are that you're already leveraging the power of MIDI. MIDI got it's start in the early 1980s
					when a group of music industry leaders worked to create a standardized protocol for communication
					between electronic musical instruments. It was a collaborative effort of key players from device
					manufacturers that eventually gave birth to MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface).
				</p>

				<p>
					When MIDI came on the scene, stuff changed. Musicians used to be limited to standalone
					instruments that couldn't easily interact, but with MIDI, they instantly gained the
					ability to connect synthesizers, drum machines, and other gear. By allowing different
					devices from various manufacturers to communicate and synchronize with each other, MIDI
					became the unifying language of music.
				</p>

				<p class="mt-16">
					<span class="text-4xl font-bold">The Now.</span> Today MIDI is the backbone of a musician's
					creative process, shaping the way we compose, record, and produce sound. And by harnessing
					the capabilities of blockchain technology, a new era in how MIDI is bought, sold and shared
					has arrived.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sono Bay is the first and only NFT marketplace for MIDI that allows users to convert their
					MIDI packs into digital assets on the blockchain in the form of NFTs. This fusion of MIDI
					and non-fungible technology presents a new host of possibilities for musicians and
					producers. Having your MIDI pack on the blockchain brings a level of true digital
					ownership that hasn't been possible until now, and for the first time ever you can sell
					MIDI packs that you've bought and no longer want. We think that's cool.
				</p>

				<p>
					On Sono Bay artists can showcase, share, and monetize their MIDI creations and
					collections. Sellers benefit from a new revenue stream, while buyers get access to
					high-quality MIDI content for their own projects. Sono Bay is adding a new way to get the
					most out of your synthesizer experience, and we’re glad you’re here!
				</p>
